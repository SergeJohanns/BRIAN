# Brainf-uck
 Repository for my brainf tools and projects

## BRIAN.py
 Brian.py is the brainf interpreter I wrote for personal use. It has a command line where you can enter code line by line as well as load seperate script files. It also supports injecting files into and writing files from memory.
 
## TextToBrainoof.py
 TTBf is a script that takes in an arbitrary string and generates a brainf script to print it. It is optimised for short code, but not optimally so. It breaks the string up into substrings whose characters are near in ASCII space to prevent excessively long adjustments.
 
## Scripts
 I also uploaded a few scripts I made while playing around with the language.
